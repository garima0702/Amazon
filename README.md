We’ve built an innovative prototype – a partially functional Amazon clone that fully realizes our idea, with other already existing functionalities yet to be implemented!

Repair Tab:

Users need to enter UserId (int), ProductId (int), and provide product details.
After submitting the details, users can request repair service.
The entered data is stored in the database.
After submission, users can return to the home page.
Note: Since login/authentication is not implemented, UserId and ProductId are used to uniquely identify users and products in the database.
Resale Marketplace:

Admin maintains a database with productId, category, and condition of products in Amazon warehouses.
Products are displayed based on their condition (e.g., resale, refurbished, gently used).
Items eligible for resale are offered at discounted prices.
Amazon Helper:

A recommendation system that suggests whether to Repair or Return a product based on its condition.
Users enter the ProductId to fetch data from the database and get recommendations.
Credits:

The equivalent price of the product is calculated, and 10% is added to it.
The user receives credits for future purchases.
This system encourages users to earn credits rather than requesting a refund, motivating further purchases.   write some content for creating a demo of the project
